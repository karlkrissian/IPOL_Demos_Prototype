# IPOL_Demos_Prototype
Prototype for building IPOL demos from a single file description

This prototype is based on AngularJS tutorial available at 
https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial

to install dependencies and start the server, type:
  npm start 
from the main directory of the project (you need to have npm and bower installed).

You can then see the result at localhost:8000/app
